We set a limit move(10) at the beginning of the game and Users can swap the adjustment candys on the map and get score. If the score reaches the target socre(80) or use out all the moves, the game will be terminated automatically. We also check is there a possible move in the map to make sure user can alway get some points by swapping the candy, if not the game will be refreshed.
